The 31.5 kilometers of roads that are off limits to the public, will be used for testing the autonomously driven car.
They have completed over 300,000 autonomous driving miles (500,000 kilometers) accident-free.
The car had to autonomously deal with a number of situations on the road.
Over 839 miles of driving, we averaged 29 miles per gallon, for the 3317 pound sedan.
The car went round the 3 mile off road lap in 11 minutes and 50 seconds, which is an average of around 15 miles per hour.
